# Google MT5 Fine-Tuning for English-Hindi Translation

## Overview
This repository contains code and instructions for fine-tuning the Google MT5 (Multilingual Translation) model for English-Hindi translation using the dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaibhavkumar11/hindi-english-parallel-corpus/). Additionally, it outlines the future scope of extending the model for English to Hinglish translation.

## Dataset
We acquired the dataset for fine-tuning from the following Kaggle link:
- [Hindi-English Parallel Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaibhavkumar11/hindi-english-parallel-corpus/)

Ensure that you have downloaded and preprocessed the dataset as per your requirements before proceeding with the fine-tuning process.

## Fine-Tuning Instructions
Follow these steps to fine-tune the Google MT5 model for English-Hindi translation:

1. **Setup Environment:** Set up your Python environment with the necessary libraries and dependencies.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the dataset for fine-tuning by cleaning, tokenizing, and formatting it appropriately.

3. **Fine-Tuning Configuration:** Configure the hyperparameters, model architecture, and training settings. You may choose to fine-tune the entire model or specific layers.

4. **Training:** Train the model on your prepared dataset. Monitor the training process and adjust hyperparameters as needed.

5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the fine-tuned model on validation data to measure its translation performance.

6. **Testing:** Test the model on unseen data to assess its real-world translation capabilities.

7. **Inference:** Deploy the fine-tuned model for English-Hindi translation tasks as required.

## Future Scope
As a potential future scope, consider extending the capabilities of this model to perform English to Hinglish translation. This can be achieved by collecting a dataset of English-Hinglish parallel sentences and adapting the fine-tuning process accordingly. Be sure to explore the feasibility and availability of such a dataset for this task.
